== Deploy via a Kubernetes Deployment

One way to deploy the application would be to have the images for the front-end and back-end microservice containers already created (via CI/CD) and stored in an image repository.
You can then create Kubernetes deployments (YAML) and use those to deploy the application.
We will do that now.

=== Create new project

. Create a new project called "ostoy" in your cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project ostoy-${GUID}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "ostoy-6xjt6" on server "https://api.rosa-6xjt6.qkm6.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

=== Deploy the backend microservice

The microservice serves internal web requests and returns a JSON object containing the current hostname and a randomly generated color string.

. In your terminal deploy the microservice using the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -n ostoy-${GUID} -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment.apps/ostoy-microservice created
service/ostoy-microservice-svc created
----

=== Deploy the front-end service

The frontend deployment contains the node.js frontend for our application along with a few other Kubernetes objects.

If you open the _ostoy-frontend-deployment.yaml_ you will see we are defining:

* Persistent Volume Claim
* Deployment Object
* Service
* Route
* Configmaps
* Secrets

. In your terminal, deploy the frontend along with creating all objects mentioned above by entering:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -n ostoy-${GUID} -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-frontend-deployment.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
persistentvolumeclaim/ostoy-pvc created
deployment.apps/ostoy-frontend created
service/ostoy-frontend-svc created
route.route.openshift.io/ostoy-route created
secret/ostoy-secret-env created
configmap/ostoy-configmap-files created
secret/ostoy-secret created
----

=== Get the route

. Get the route so that we can access the application.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get route
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
ostoy-route-ostoy-6xjt6.apps.rosa-6xjt6.qkm6.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

=== View the app

Copy the host name of your route above and paste it into your browser and press enter (if you are on a *Chrome* based browser make sure to type `http` - `https` will not work for this application).

You should see the homepage of our application.

If the page does not come up make sure that it is using `http` and *not* `https`.
